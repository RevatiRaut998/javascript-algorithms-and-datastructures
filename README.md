# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 

🧠 This repository contains projects, apps, and exercises I built while practicing JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
It includes hands-on coding challenges and mini-apps that focus on **core JavaScript fundamentals**, 
including:

- Data types & variables
- Loops & iteration
- Conditional logic
- Functions & scope
- Arrays and objects
- String & number manipulation
- Algorithm design and problem solving

## 🛠️ Why This Repo Matters

This repo tracks my journey of mastering JavaScript from the ground up — not just for academic purposes, but to build real job-ready skills that I’ll use in frontend development with Angular and TypeScript.

All logic is written from scratch without frameworks, to focus on building raw problem-solving power.
