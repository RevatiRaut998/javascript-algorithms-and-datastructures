# FreeCodeCamp – JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 🧠

This repository contains all my projects, apps, and exercises completed during the [freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification]
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

It includes hands-on coding challenges and mini-apps that focus on **core JavaScript fundamentals**, including:

- Data types & variables
- Loops & iteration
- Conditional logic
- Functions & scope
- Arrays and objects
- String & number manipulation
- Algorithm design and problem solving

## 🛠️ Why This Repo Matters

This repo tracks my journey of mastering JavaScript from the ground up — not just for academic purposes, but to build real job-ready skills that I’ll use in frontend development with Angular and TypeScript.

All logic is written from scratch without frameworks, to focus on building raw problem-solving power.
