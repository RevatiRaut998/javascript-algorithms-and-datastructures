# ðŸ“˜ Gradebook App

This JavaScript app calculates class average, assigns a letter grade to a student, and returns a pass/fail message.  
Built as part of my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures course.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- `for...of` loops and array iteration  
- Conditional logic with `if/else`  
- Function reuse and decomposition  
- Boolean checks for grade status  
- Dynamic message formatting with string concatenation

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

Input:
- Class scores: `[92, 88, 12, 77, 57, 100, 67, 38, 97, 89]`
- Student score: `37`

Output:
Class average: 71.7. Your grade: F. You failed the course.
